# ScrollHelper

Swift library to help implement dynamic behavior when scrolling in a UIScrollView.

For now, see [the tests](https://github.com/zef/ScrollHelper/blob/master/ScrollHelperTests/ScrollHelperTests.swift) and [code](https://github.com/zef/ScrollHelper/blob/master/ScrollHelper/ScrollHelper.swift) for usage. And feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

# TODO

- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Create sample project with demo
- [ ] Make class and methods public so it can be included as a framework
- [ ] Possibly add enum values for `Side` that can take arguments with a trigger distance
